SMS Spoofing Utility - overhaul of the original ["smsisher"](https://github.com/XiphosResearch/smsisher) I wrote while working at Xiphos Research. Some code reused, most improvements are to usability based on end-user feedback.

Suggested use is for sending creeps at the bar texts from their mum so they leave you alone to enjoy your delicious beverages in peace.
